# Codevember 2016

I use the codesimple "elm in docker" toolset.
To build any day's project I use

`elm make src/${day}.elm`

This produces `index.html` which I can then view or upload.

Each day is src/C11XX.elm, which should contain a 'Main' module.

# C1102
Just learning to use the Kwarrtz/render graphics library. A simple color wheel.
